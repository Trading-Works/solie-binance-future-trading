**Solie** is a GUI trading bot designed for targeting the futures markets of Binance.

It enables you to create and customize your own trading strategies, simulating them using real historical data from Binance with the power of Python.

Please note that while this solution provides tools for strategy development, profitability is not guaranteed as success depends on individual decision-making.

Solie connects to Binance, retrieves real-time market and account data, saves it on disk, and presents it as intuitive charts to assist users in strategy development.

## üõû Usage

### Preparation

First, install [Python](https://www.python.org/). Don't forget to add `python` command to PATH during the installation. You can check that Python is ready with the terminal command below.

```bash
python --version
```

Then, install Solie.

```
pip install solie
```

### Inside Terminal

You can easily run Solie with the command below.

```
python -m solie
```

### With a Script File

For convenience, you can make a custom Python script file that has the extension `.py`. Just copy and paste the content below in the file.

```python
import solie

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solie.bring_to_life()
```

Solie will be brought to life once you execute the Python script file.

Note that on Windows, giving the extension `.pyw` to the file allows you to hide the terminal window and only leave the GUI.
